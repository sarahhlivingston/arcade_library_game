# 2D Arcade Game Development Project

A Python-based 2D game development project using the Arcade library.

## 🎮 Game Ideas

Here are some exciting 2D game concepts we can build:

### 1. **Space Shooter** 🚀
- Player controls a spaceship
- Dodge asteroids and enemy ships
- Collect power-ups
- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty

### 2. **Platform Runner** 🏃‍♂️
- Character that runs and jumps
- Collect coins and avoid obstacles
- Multiple platforms and moving elements
- Score-based progression

### 3. **Breakout Clone** 🏓
- Classic brick-breaking game
- Paddle controls, bouncing ball
- Different colored bricks with different points
- Power-ups and special effects

### 4. **Snake Game** 🐍
- Classic snake gameplay
- Growing snake, food collection
- Obstacles and walls
- Speed increases over time

### 5. **Puzzle Platformer** 🧩
- Character that can push blocks
- Solve puzzles to reach the exit
- Multiple levels with increasing complexity
- Collectible items

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation Steps

1. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd arcade_library_game
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

4. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Test the installation:**
   ```bash
   python test_setup.py
   ```

## 📋 Development Plan

We'll build the game in stages to ensure everything works properly:

### **Stage 1: Foundation & Setup** ✅
- [x] Project structure setup
- [x] Dependencies installation
- [x] Basic window creation
- [x] Game loop implementation

### **Stage 2: Basic Game Mechanics**
- [ ] Player character creation
- [ ] Basic movement controls
- [ ] Simple graphics and sprites
- [ ] Collision detection basics

### **Stage 3: Game Elements**
- [ ] Obstacles and enemies
- [ ] Collectibles (coins, power-ups)
- [ ] Score system
- [ ] Health/lives system

### **Stage 4: Level Design**
- [ ] Multiple levels
- [ ] Level progression
- [ ] Background graphics
- [ ] Sound effects (optional)

### **Stage 5: Polish & Features**
- [ ] Menu system
- [ ] Game over/restart functionality
- [ ] High score tracking
- [ ] Final testing and bug fixes

## 🎯 Current Focus: Stage 1

Let's start with creating a basic game window and testing our setup!

## 🚀 Quick Start

After installation, run:
```bash
python main.py
```

This will open a basic game window to confirm everything is working.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Arcade library not found:** Make sure you've activated your virtual environment
2. **Display issues:** Check if your system supports OpenGL
3. **Import errors:** Verify all dependencies are installed with `pip list`
